        <h3>"Why"</h3>
        <p>So I try to retrace
            A memory of her face
            Every day that goes by
            Still makes me wonder why
            
            Why
            Doesn't it make sense?
            Why
            Did we lose what it meant?
            And what was the consequence?</p>
